          <h2>Watamu</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            <b>Watamu</b> – meaning “home of the sweet people” in Swahili – is a small village on the Kenya coast approximately <b>120kms north of Mombasa</b> – Kenya. <b>Watamu</b> is also 15kms south of <b>Malindi</b> – Vasco de Gama’s first landing point on the coast of East Africa. Watamu’s shoreline features pristine white sand beaches and offshore coral formations arranged in different bays and sheltered by a reef, <b>Watamu</b> area is protected as part of the <b>Watamu Marine National Park</b> and is considered one of the best <b>snorkeling</b> and <b>diving areas</b> on the coast of Africa. The <b>Watamu Marine Park</b> is renowned worldwide for its natural beauty and boasts a diverse marine life from the visiting <b>whale sharks</b> and manta rays to three species of <b>Watamu sea turtle</b>. Like <b>Mombasa, Watamu Malindi</b> is an ancient Swahili trading port that fell under Portuguese influence in the 16th century. <b>Watamu</b> is far smaller and more low-rise than Mombasa and has a less conspicuous sense of antiquity, though the old town is scattered with a few important historical landmarks, separated from Malindi by 15km of Indian Ocean frontage, Watamu feels less like a beach resort town than an overgrown fishing village and is all the better for it, boasting arguably the most gorgeous beach in Kenya, Watamu also offers superb offshore snorkeling in the calm, transparent waters of <b>Watamu Turtle Bay, Watamu</b> stands practically within walking distance of the jungle-bound ruined medieval city of Gedi and forest wildlife of <b>Arabuko-Sokoke National Park</b>. Watamu epitomize tropical beach holiday paradise: picture-perfect beaches, clear ocean waters, and the space to do as much or as little as you please. And there’s no shortage of activities on offer. If you thought Hawaii was the only ultimate playground for the <b>super-rich</b>, then you clearly haven’t been to Watamu-Posh, luxurious, chic: Watamu is everything that makes it an attractive <b>beach holiday</b> destination for <b>billionaires</b> and rich <b>celebrities</b> from around the world, this magnificent slice of coastline is where Versace-clad A-listers and foreign and <b>Kenyan wealthy billionaires</b> spend it like Beckham – so why not join them? The lifestyle of the rich and famous includes fabulous <b>beach vacations</b>.

Little Italy is what is called the small town situated in Kenya Coast, called Watamu. Then, just before you reach Watamu you will find the neighboring town known as Malindi.

There’s something very special about these parts, but the first thing that will intrigue you is the fact that both areas are filled with Italians.

Watamu Little Italy is about 557.4 km away from Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya, and 108.1 north of Mombasa. In addition, right next door is its neighbor, the rich tropical rainforest called <b>Arabuko Sokoke National Park</b>. This is an incredibly lush, tropical forest and supports a number of endemic and endangered animals. Perhaps if you dream of traveling to the Maldives or the Caribbean, then you should travel here instead. It’s a lot less populated and the white beaches are vast and expansive. Better yet, everybody here is extremely helpful and proactive. You can expect to see the locals up early getting their exercise in for the day on the beach or starting their work for the day. Watamu is fit, healthy, and relaxed. They often like to say, ‘Pole Pole’ which means slowly slowly – take it easy. The area is quiet and if you would like a slower pace of life then this is the holiday destination for you. The fishermen take their boats out early in the morning and there’s always a guy ready to take you for a trip around the islands starting at 7 a.m. Have a delicious lunch, prepared with seafood fresh from the sea.  The best part about this lifestyle is the freshness of the food and the delicious Swahili coconut rice and fish curry. You can order your lobster tails, shrimps, red snapper, calamari, crab, prawns and coral fish from the fisherman directly. You might also want to explore the Mangroves and paddleboard along Mida Creek. The <b>Watamu National Marine Park and Reserve</b> offer kitesurfing, paddleboarding, boogie-boarding, snorkeling, and sailing. It also boasts a glorious coral reef with 1000 species of reef fish and sightings of manta rays, grouper, and barracuda. A world-renowned diving destination, Watamu offers year-round clear water and an impressive selection of world-class dive profiles including cliffs, drop-offs, night dives, and wreck dives. Watamu is also known as the game fishing capital of East Africa, boasting record-breaking marlin, wahoo, and sailfish. Watamu village is a unique mix of enchanting Swahili culture and modern facilities. There are Italian coffee shops, gelato bars, wine shops, delicatessens, and bakeries. Restaurants range from gourmet to authentic local cuisine, and in the evening there’s a great selection of bars, discos, and clubs. The beaches of Watamu are a favourite nesting site for green, hawksbill, olive ridley, and leatherback turtles. Watamu is also famous for its dolphins and you can enjoy the rare treat of snorkeling or stand-up paddle boarding alongside them. Migratory pods of <b>humpback whales</b> pass by Watamu between june and September and often ‘breach’ right off the headland – so close, you can see them from your bar stool. Between September and December, you can snorkel among the gentle whale sharks, the planet’s largest fish. Watamu lies just 7 km from the ruins of the 12th-century Swahili city of <b>Gedi</b> with its Sultan’s temples, market places, and city streets. The most significant monuments in Malindi Old Town are a pair of 15th-century pillar tombs standing in front of the seafront Friday Mosque and a small thatched chapel built by the Portuguese in the early 16th century. The limestone Da Gama Cross, erected by the pioneering Portuguese navigator Vasco Da Gama after he landed at Malindi in 1499, stands on a windswept coral peninsula a short walk south of the town center. The National Museum of Malindi is housed in the three-story waterfront ‘House of Columns’ built by an Indian trader circa 1890. Displays include a stuffed 77kg (170lb) coelacanth and a collection of engraved Gohu burial totems. Malindi and Watamu have good sandy swimming beaches, but the latter’s Turtle Bay stands out scenically, thanks to a distinctive forest of ragged coral formations that rise out of the preposterously clear water like giant mushrooms. Africa’s oldest marine reserve, <b>Malindi Marine National Reserve</b>, protects 213km2 (82 square miles) of offshore reefs and open water, running south from Malindi to Mida Creek. It offers some of East Africa’s finest marine wildlife viewing, with the tranquil coral gardens of Watamu’s Turtle Bay ideal for snorkeling, while diving is usually undertaken on the more extensive barrier reefs further out to sea. Separated from the open sea by the <b>Watamu Peninsula</b>, Mida Creek is an essential marine bird-watching site that can be explored on a stilted boardwalk and small hide constructed as part of a community-based ecotourism project. A vital wintering site for Palaearctic migrants such as Crab plover and Grey plover, it is also a good place for Mangrove kingfisher and Greater flamingo. The surrounding coastal scrub hosts the less striking, but very rare, Sokoke pipit. The 420km2 (162 square mile) Arabuko-Sokoke National Park protects East Africa’s largest remaining tract of coastal forest and a host of globally threatened and near-endemic mammals and birds, including Ader’s duiker, Sokoke dog mongoose, Yellow-rumped elephant-shrew, Chestnut-fronted helmetshrike, Clarke’s weaver and Sokoke scops owl. Large fresh paths often seen on the park’s extensive network of roads and walking trails serve to remind that it’s also home to a furtive and seldom-seen population of 120 elephants. The most impressive and atmospheric of the many medieval ruins along the Kenyan coast, Gedi National Monument protects the remains of a 20-hectare walled Swahili city-state that flourished as a cabinet of maritime trade between the 11th and 13th centuries. The museum displays artifacts found on site but manufactured from as far afield as India, Egypt, Arabia, and Spain, and the jungle-bound ruins include a 900m2 (9,688 square foot) Sultan’s Palace and eight mosques. A birdwatching platform high in a baobab tree between the palace and the largest mosque offers a superb monkey’s-eye overview of the site. Also known as Hell’s Kitchen, the Marafa Depression, 35km (22mi) northwest of Malindi, is studded with spectacular sandstone pillars that stand up to 30m (98ft) tall and come across like a miniature version of the Grand Canyon. It is most impressive in the early morning when the layered columns glow pink. Sheltered by the curve of the tidal Mida Creek and fringed by a barrier reef, Watamu, on Kenya’s central coast, is a mecca for snorkelling and diving, and makes for a relaxing post-safari stay. You can take a boat out to <b>Watamu Marine National</b> Park to explore the kaleidoscopic sea life that flits among the corals. You could also explore by paddleboard, try kitesurfing, or navigate the creek by dugout canoe. Between activities, relax on white-sand beaches or, at low tide, investigate shallow pools filled with shells, seaweed, and skittering ghost crabs. In the village, you can browse stalls selling bright fabrics and local carvings, sip drinks in the cafes, and taste seafood fresh from fishermen’s nets. You might also like to venture just outside town to visit the Ruins of Gedi — remnants of a medieval Swahili trade hub,

          <h2>Malindi vs watamu</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
          Heading north from Mombasa, you’ll find Watamu and Malindi, both excellent Kenya beach holiday destinations with a variety of luxury properties to choose from. Coral reefs fringe the powdery white sand and marine life flourishes in the warm turquoise ocean. Life here is laid back, and with direct flights from the Masai Mara to Malindi, a stay here perfectly complements a Kenya safari holiday. The beautiful attractions in Watamu make it a beautiful, underrated location where you combine archaeological sites dating back hundreds of years with lush forests home to elephants, sandy beaches and coral gardens. The small but beautiful coastal town is situated just over 100km north of Mombasa, and less than 30 minutes from <b>Malindi</b>, featuring a shoreline of wonder and a lifestyle driven by harmony with nature and an unbreakable connection between the residents. Here, the metropolitan chaos of Nairobi and Mombasa are forgotten, and a calm excitement settles in. The shoreline is arranged in different bays and beaches, namely <b>Garoda Beach, Turtle Bay, Blue Lagoon Bay, Watamu Bay</b> and <b>Jacaranda beach</b>, all protected as part of the Watamu Marine National Park. The Marine Park is considered to be one of the best snorkeling and diving sites on the Kenya coast and with its sparkling white sand beaches, it is also rated the third-best beach in Africa. With the diversity of culture and attractions in Watamu, your beach holidays can be anything from a peaceful beach getaway to an adventurous trip or even an educational excursion or all three wrapped up together by the warmth of the sun and was worth the wait after lockdowns. On a tailor made <b>Watamu beach holiday</b> you'll experience one of the most undeveloped and idyllic villages on the coast, having preserved its natural surroundings and retained a peaceful, laid-back way of life. There are no high-rise beach hotels here, just a beautifully curated handful of boutique offerings scattered along long beach. A beach holiday here is all about barefoot walks in the sand, haggling for fresh coconuts with street vendors, swimming in the impossibly tropical seas, and exploring the Watamu Marine National Park. Guests can explore the rich local culture and history, sample the fusion cuisine and fresh seafood, or get active by kite surfing, diving, or fishing. At the southern end of Watamu is Mida Creek, a large mangrove-fringed saltwater creek perfect for birding, canoeing and visiting the famous Crab Shack for a spot of lunch with the locals. A sunset dhow trip up the creek is a must on any Watamu holiday. Less than half an hour from Watamu, Malindi is the last sizeable town on the south coast before reaching <b>Lamu Island</b>. It’s one of the oldest coastal settlements with an interesting mix of Swahili, Arab, colonial settlers and Italians, who have resided here for many years. A <b>Malindi beach holiday</b> is all about beautiful white sand, and the coral reefs have been declared the <b>Malindi Marine National Park</b>, which is a superb place for diving, snorkelling, surfing, and fishing for marlin shark and sailfish - <b>Is Malindi better</b> than <b>Watamu</b>? Similar to <b>Mombasa- Malindi</b> is a historic Swahili port that was influenced by Portugal in the sixteenth century. Although there are a few significant historical landmarks strewn around the old town, it is much smaller, more low-rise, and has a less obvious feeling of antiquity than Mombasa. More than any other similarly sized town in Kenya, Malindi serves primarily as a beach resort these days. In addition to a vibrant seaside restaurant scene and a variety of other ur520630546 diversions, such as supermarkets and <b>Malindi nightclubs</b>, it provides a fair selection of midrange lodges targeted at the European package market. Watamu is better off feeling more like an overgrown fishing village and less like a vacation town because it is separated from Malindi by 6km of Indian Ocean beachfront. In addition to having what is perhaps Kenya’s most beautiful beach, Watamu has excellent offshore snorkelling in Turtle Bay’s serene, clear waters. It is virtually walking distance from Arabuko-Sokoke National Park’s woodland animals and the mediaeval city of Gedi, which is surrounded by a jungle. The two pillar tombs from the 15th century that face the Friday Mosque on the waterfront and the modest thatched church constructed by the Portuguese in the early 16th century are the two most important landmarks in Malindi Old Town. The Portuguese explorer Vasco Da Gama built the limestone Da Gama Cross on a windswept coral peninsula a short stroll south of the town centre, following his landing at Malindi in 1499.Built by an Indian trader around 1890, the three-story waterfront “House of Columns” serves as the home of the National Museum of Malindi. A collection of etched Gohu funeral totems and a stuffed 77kg (170lb) coelacanth are among the displays. The area can be reached by road and also via flights from the capital city Nairobi, taking just over an hour in total by air. Differences between the two towns guarantee that there is something for everyone in this exotic and exciting part of Kenya! With some great culinary options, spectacular accommodation, vibrant nightlife, and one of the best beaches in the whole of Africa, Watamu and Malindi are two destinations that are well worth visiting during your Kenya holiday! Both <b>Watamu and Malindi</b> offer nice sandy beaches for swimming, but Watamu’s Turtle Bay is particularly picturesque because of a unique forest of jagged coral formations that emerge out of the absurdly clear water like enormous mushrooms. Malindi Marine National Reserve, the oldest marine reserve in Africa, spans 213 km2 (82 square miles) and preserves open ocean and offshore reefs south of Malindi to Mida Creek. It provides some of the best opportunities for seeing marine life in East Africa. Diving is often done on the larger barrier reefs farther out to sea, while snorkelling is great in Watamu’s Turtle Bay’s serene coral gardens. Mombasa is roughly a 30-minute drive north of Watamu and Malindi. Scheduled flights are available from Mombasa, Lamu, and Nairobi to Malindi, whose airport is located less than 20 km (12 mi) from Watamu and 3 km (1,9 km) from the town core.

          <h2>The Watamu Bay</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <b>The Watamu Bay</b>, north of the <b>Blue Lagoon</b> and <b>Watamu Town</b> is surrounded by seven coral rock islands, known as the Seven Islands (not to be confused with the eponymous hotel deriving its name from the same feature). These islands form a shallow, semi-enclosed lagoon with very warm and calm waters. With the exception of a few, rocky areas, this lagoon is also devoid of the sea urchins you find in most other parts of the Kenya Coast. While going for a swim in the Indian Ocean is a no-brainer anywhere along Kenya’s coastline, the north side of Watamu holds a particular allure, as most of the bay is shallow enough to sit down. Unbeatable when traveling with small kids!

            <b>The Blue Lagoon</b> is a shallow bay, almost enclosed by two cliffs, with an island in the middle. The white sand dune could have been idyllic had it not been for the rotting seaweed covering big parts of the beach, leaving a rather unpleasant smell.

          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Who doesn’t love the sight of glorious <b>sea turtles</b> swimming about, coming ashore to nest, their tiny hatchlings scurrying back out to sea to begin the cycle anew? This was a common site on Kenya’s coast but then human intrusion – poaching and accidents threatened the beloved turtles. The local Watamu residents were alarmed at this loss and jumped to the rescue forming patrols of the <b>watamu turtles’</b> beach nests, ensuring they were left unbothered. It was a first step toward the turtles’ survival. That was in 1997 when the <b>Watamu Turtle Watch</b> was formed and over the years it has grown to include a <b>watamu turtle rehabilitation center</b> and several programs involving the public in the care and appreciation of the local sea life. Today, <b>watamu Turtle Watch</b> operates under the umbrella of the <b>Local Ocean Trust</b>, Over the years, more than 900 turtle nests have been monitored and over 73,000 Turtle hatchlings have survived their journey back to the ocean. The Trust invites guests to visit their <b>Marine Information Centre</b> to view displays, learn about the area’s prized turtles and the efforts being made to ensure their continued survival. The <b>Turtle Centre</b> receives about 2,000 visitors a year. You also don’t want to miss the Trust’s <b>Turtle Rehabilitation Centre</b> where sick and injured turtles are treated and eventually released back to the ocean. Allow us to coordinate a visit to the neighboring Turtle "hospital" operated by the Local Ocean Trust. This remarkable charity not only provides care for injured and ill turtles residing along our beach but also conducts vital research and plays a crucial role in educating the local community about the significance of sustainable marine conservation.

                rave reviews on popular travel website TripAdvisor. The video below sums up the Tribe 
                Watersports offering, and explains why Watamu is such a perfect destination for kitesurfing and 
                other watersports. Ben Kelliher, owner and manager of Tribe Watersports, has more than a 
                decade of experience in kitesurfing coaching and his knowledge of local conditions, as well as 
                his way with people, makes him the perfect mentor. Below are some more photos of ocean 
                activities in Watamu, courtesy of Tribe Watersports. Water sports are available in the central 
                waters but this is a calm place, so rather hire a kayak or a SUP a take a moment of meditative 
                solitude.

            <h2>Visit the Arabuko Sokoke Forest</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
              If you’re looking for a short escape from the beaches and the ocean, add a trip to the Arabuko Sokoke Forest to your itinerary. This unique ecosystem contains flora and fauna, including shrubs, rare bird species, butterflies, and wild animals. It’s a nature lovers paradise. The forest is perfect for bird-watching enthusiasts, with over 200 bird species to spot, including the endemic Clarke’s weaver. It’s also home to plenty of butterflies and wildlife, such as the savannah elephants, monkeys, Aders’s duiker, and the beautiful golden-rumped elephant shrew. When in Watamu, I love taking a break in this serene forest. You can take a nature walk along different paths that lead to dense vegetation and open clearings. All the while, you’ll be listening to the sounds of various birds, tracking wildlife, watching beautiful butterflies, and enjoying the fresh air – it’s easy to forget that you’re at the coast whilst surrounded by such greenery
            </p>
            <h2>Casuarina</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
              <b>Casuarina</b> is the relatively quiet beach area between <b>Watamu</b> and <b>Malindi</b>. Most movement between the two towns goes through the main road a few km further to the west, so Casuarina Road remains untarmacked for now. The dirt road is no challenge for a 4WD, though, and if you want a different and quieter vibe, you could start here. The beaches in Casuarina are vast and not very busy. It’s illegal to snorkel in the water off Watamu without a permit.  Buy a ticket at the KWS hut next to Turtle Bay; any tuk-tuk driver will take you there. Don’t be tempted to go without; they patrol the beaches asking for permits. The reef is about 1km out to shore, boats moor at the northern end of Turtle Bay opposite <b>Ocean Sports Club</b> costing 2000 KSH adult resident 2500 nonresident.  However, just tootling around in the shallows off shore we saw moray eels, blue spotted rays and a variety of tropical fish. Watamu offers a wide range of Water-related activities. From Wake-boarding and Water-skiing in Mida Creek, Kayaking and fun-boats to scuba diving and snorkeling. Kite-surfing too has taken off in a big way in Watamu. <b>Watamu is one of the world's top destinations for Deep Sea Fishing, with the majority of skippers supporting the 'Tag and Release' system, to allow the sport to continue well into the future</b>. How about a day trip out on the creek, with a barbeque - or a goggling trip Coral Gardens. Try the Discover Watamu boat. There is a large choice of restaurant, bars in Watamu - the Pilipan offers Asian-fusion, and the Italian influence in Mpango is clear in the thin pizzas. The Ice creams at Anna and Andreas are something else and everywhere there are opportunities to sample fresh seafood.

            <h2>How to Get to Watamu </h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
              <b>By Air:</b> If you are traveling from abroad, or you are not a fan of road trips, then the obvious way to access Malindi, Watamu or Kilifi is by air. The small and convenient Malindi Airport only serves domestic routes at the moment, but funds and land have been allocated to expand into an international airport. - <b>By Road from Nairobi:</b> If, on the other hand, you are nearly as fond of <b>road trips</b> as I am, then fuel up and hit the road! The Standard Gauge Railway, launched in 2017, removed most of the truck and bus madness that used to make the road a death trap and turned it into something quite pleasant. It is still Kenya, so look out for mad drivers, nevertheless. The slow and scenic option is to go through Kenya’s largest national park, Tsavo East. I have done that journey twice, and I can totally recommend it, especially the route along Galana River! The much faster route is via the fairly recently tarmacked shortcut from Mariakani to Kilifi town. That one takes almost exactly one hour with normal speed, completely bypassing Mombasa. Voilà, you are in Kilifi County!

Watamu beach is a favorite coastal beach holiday destination in Kenya, some tourists head to Diani where the long white sand beach speaks of romance and <b>honeymoon vacation</b> and but the best all round beach travel destination in Kenya is Watamu. Watamu Beach has a distinctive coastline. Watamu beaches are dotted with tiny deserted islets. Sandbars rise out of the ocean offering walkways to the islands at low tide or places to bask with a cocktail at high. The soft white sand beaches are sprinkled with starfish and weeny hermit crabs. The shoreline is festooned with palms, where, hidden within the lush bush, are houses dating back to colonial times. Thatched roofs hide affluent Kenyans lounging in pools, sipping their gin and tonics. Elsewhere, houses stand in disrepair; their walls stained black with time and salt winds, their roofs long since collapsed, the gardens full of chattering monkeys and iridescent lizards. Occasionally the serenity of the coastline is broken up by a <b>5-star beach resort</b> where pale tourists lie in the shade and sip from the coconuts that boys sell on the beach. Away from the <b>Watamu beach hotels</b>, Watamu fishing boats pull up at lunchtime and disgorge their catch: octopus, prawns, snapper and huge crayfish, celebrity chefs from the nearby <b>Watamu beach houses</b> haggle at the boats; the fish is taken <b>Watamu beach homes</b> and turned into curries<br> Explore Watamu Beaches With perfect year-round weather, turquoise waters, and fine white sands, Watamu stands out as one of Kenya’s best beach destinations.
